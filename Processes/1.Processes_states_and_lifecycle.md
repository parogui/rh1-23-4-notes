A process consist of:

* Address space on allocated memory
* Security properties including ownership credentials and privileges
* One or more execution threads of program code
* Process state

**Environment** of a process contains:
* Local and global variables
* Current scheduling context
* Allocated system resources

# Process states

## Running

* R - TASK_RUNNING -> Is executing on CPU or waiting to run.
 * Runnable
 * Running

## Sleeping

* S - TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE -> Is waiting for some condition (hardware, system resource, or signal), once received, returns to Running.
* D - TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE -> Is sleeping but does not respond to signals. **Used when process interruption may cause unpredictable device state**
* K - TASK_KILLABLE -> Identical to D, but allow a waiting task to respond to a kill signal.
* I - TASK_REPORT_IDLE -> Subset of state D. Kernel does not count those when calculating load. Similar to D, accepts kill signals.

## Stopped

* T - TASK_STOPPED -> Suspended, usualy being signaled by user or another process. Can be resumed.
* T - TASK_TRACED -> Is being debugged (temporarily stopped).

## Zombie

* Z - EXIT_ZOMBIE -> A child process signals to its parets as it exists. **All resources except PID are released**
* X - EXIT_DEAD -> When the parent cleans up the remaining child structure. The process is now released completely.
