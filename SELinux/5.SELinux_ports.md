The ports defined as SELinux contexts can be shown running:

```
semanage ports -l
```

The ports can be related to services by looking for the port on the `/etc/services` file.

A port label can be added to a port by running:

```
semanage port -a -t port_label -p tcp|udp PORTNUMBER
```

To list manually changed SELinux port contexts:

```
semanage port -l -C
```
