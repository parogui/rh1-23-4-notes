A system log is categorized by facility (which subsystem produces the message) and priority (message's severity).

Syslog facilities:

* 0 - kern
* 1 - user
* 2 - mail
* 3 - daemon
* 4 - auth
* 5 - syslog
* 6 - lpr
* 7 - news
* 8 - uucp
* 9 - cron
* 10 - authpriv
* 11 - ftp
* 16-23 - local0 to local7

Syslog priorities:

* 0 - emerg
* 1 - alert
* 2 - crit
* 3 - err
* 4 - warning
* 5 - notice
* 6 - info
* 7 - debug

The way log messages are stored is defined on `/etc/rsyslog.d`:

```
authpriv.*    /var/log/secure
```

The line above configures rsyslog to store all severities of the authpriv facility messages on /var/log/secure.
