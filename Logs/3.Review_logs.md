The command `journalctl` allows 

```
journalctl [-n <number of entries>] [-f] [-p <priority>] [-u <systemd unit>] [--since <time>] [--until <time>]
```

To see the list of logs stored across boots, the following command can be used:

```
journalctl --list-boots
```

Once we know the boot we want the logs from, the `-b` option can be used:

```
journalctl -b <boot number>
```
