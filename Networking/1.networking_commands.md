## Network configuration with NMCLI

nmcli dev status -> Display the network devices and their statuses
nmcli con show [--active] -> Displays all connections
nmcli con show <connection-name> -> Displays configuration of a connection.

nmcli con add con-name <connection-name> type <ethernet> ifname <interface> [ipv4.addresses 192.168.0.5/24] [ipv4.gateway 192.168.0.254] -> Creates a connection.
nmcli con del <connection-name> -> Deletes a connection.

nmcli con up <connection-name> -> Turns on a connection
nmcli dev disconnect <device-name> -> Disconnects a device

nmcli con mod <connection-name> [ipv4.addresses 192.168.0.5/24] [ipv4.gateway 192.168.0.254] -> Edits a connection

nmcli con reload [<connection-name>] -> Reloads all connection profiles

## Network configuration manually

Connections can be edited in the connection's configuration file in `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/`

It requires a connection reload.

Manual configuration equivalency to nmcli options: `ipv4.method manual` == [ipv4] method=manual

The configuration files should only be owned by root and have 600 permissions.
