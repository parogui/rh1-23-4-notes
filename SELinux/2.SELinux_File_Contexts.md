All resources, such as processes, files, and ports are labeled with a SELinux context.

The SELinux database is located at `/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/`.

New files obtain a default label when their file name matches an existing labeling policy.

If a file does not match an existing labeling policy, iot inherits the label from its parent directory.

The context can be changed by using `semanage fcontext`, `restorecon`, and `chcon` commands.

### CHCON

To set the file context of a directory to a specific context:

```
chcon -t httpd_sys_contenct_t /directory
```

This method may survive a reboot but a system relabel or restorecon execution will remove those changes.

### Default

The `semanage fcontext` command works with the default file contexts.

The most common regular expression used in policies is the **pirate** (/.*)?

To list the default policies (-C Allow checking local customizations):

`semanage fcontext -l`

To add a context policy for a directory:

`semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/directory(/.*)?'`

To restore the default context to all files in a directory (or apply semanage changes):

`restorecon -Rv /var/www/`

To delete a custom context policy:

`semanage fcontext -d 'directory'`
