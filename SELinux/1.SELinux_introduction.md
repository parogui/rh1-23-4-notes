SELinux is a security feature of Linux.

Controls access to files, ports and other resources at a granular level.

It can be defined as:

* SELinux policy
* SELinux Boolean.

File permissions control file access for users and groups, but it does not prevent an authorized user with file access from using a file for an unintended purpose.

SELinux has 3 operational modes:

* Enforcing
* Permissive
* Disabled

### Temporarily switch the mode

The modes can be temporarily switched with the following commands:

```
getenforce # gets current mode
setenforce 1 #sets Enforcing
setenforce 0 # sets Permissive
```

It can also be switched at boot time with kernel parameters:

```
enforcing= # 1 for enforcing 0 for permissive
selinux= # 0 to disable it 1 to enable it
```

### Permanently switch the mode

It can be set at the `/etc/selinux/config` file with the SELINUX= option.
