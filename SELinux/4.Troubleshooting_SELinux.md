* SELinux consists of targeted policies that define allowable actions.
* A policy defines a **labeled process and a labeled resource** that interact.
* The **policy states** the process type, and file or port context using **labels**.
* The **policy entry defines** one process type, one resource label, and the explicit **action** to allow.
* An **action** can be a system call, a kernel function, or another specific routine.
* If no entry is created, the action is denied.
* When an action is denied, the attempt is logged.

When an action is denied, a message is logged to the `/var/log/audit/audit.log` file.

The AVC summary includes an event UUID, the `sealert` command show a report for the specific event.

To check the specific alert:

```
sealert -l UUID
```

To check all the alerts:

```
sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log
```

To search AVC events in the audit log:

```
ausearch -m AVC -ts recent
```
