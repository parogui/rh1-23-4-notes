## Checking NFS exports

Show mounts exported by a NFS3 server:

```
showmount --exports <server>
```

Show mounts exported by a NFS4 server:

```
mkdir /mountpoint
mount server:/ /mountpoint
ls /mountpoint
```

## Manually mounting NFS

* Temporarily

```
mount -t nfs -o rw,sync server:/export /mountpoint
```

* Permanently

```
echo "server:/export /mountpoint nfs rw,soft 0 0
```

## Automount NFS

The automonter is a service (autofs) that automatically mounts file systems and NFS exports on demand and umounts NFS exports when the resources are no longer in use.

The automount master map is located at `/etc/auto.master.d/`

Master map's files names must end with ".autofs".

### Indirectly mapped mounts:

```
/shares /etc/auto.demo
```

It uses the /shares directory as the base for indirect automounts and the /etc/auto.demo file for the mount details.

```
# /etc/auto.demo
work -rw,sync <server>:/shares/work
```
